# MathKit

![Example](/docs/images/example.PNG)

A set of math problem solvers used to better understand mathematical concepts. This project includes explanations and proofs in the source files' comments to give readers a more in-depth look into how each operation/function works. However, this isn't intended to be a full-fledged mathematical library for large projects. Others libraries, like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), are more suited to this role.

## Installation
Run `git clone https://github.com/Zetta56/MathKit` in your desired folder

## Testing

To test a file, run `python -m unittest test.<module_name>` (eg. `python -m unittest test.test_matrix`)

To run all tests, run `python -m unittest discover test`
